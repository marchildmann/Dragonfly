Version 0.19

  * modified Dragonfly:view; now it displays an error view if a file is not found
  * moved the constant "default404" into dragonfly_config.lsp
  * added the function autoload-css; this function checks automatically for an iPhone and loads a different stylesheet

Version 0.16

  * improved the directory structure: added three folders (dragonfly-framework, modules-active, modules-inactive)
